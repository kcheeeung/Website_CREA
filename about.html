					Since the days of the Industrial Revolution and the advent of modern medicine, the human lifespan continues to grow and still very little is known why humans become old. The average life expectancy of humans in developed countries is at least 70 years, and aging could be thought as a series of imperceptibly small changes that happen over the course of life and degrade the body’s systems and structures. Among the challenges that greets the dawn of this millennium is the maintenance of good health and the postponement or reversal of old age and its debilitating diseases.
					<br><br>
					Our mission is to investigate the basic processes that cause aging, with the goal of improving and extending human healthspan. The Center for Research and Education on Aging integrates the intellectual assets and resources at both the University and the National Laboratory to accomplish this objective. This unique partnership at CREA fosters an environment that supports both basic aging research and educates the next generation of scientists. Ultimately, we hope that our collaboration will allow researchers to gain new insights into the aging process and test new hypotheses that could drive breakthroughs in improving health and youthfulness in humans.

					On July 15, 1999, the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL), University of California, Berkeley (UC Berkeley), and BioTime gathered to sign an agreement to create an institution focusing on studying the aging process. This institute was the brainchild of Dr. Paul Segall, Ph.D. (1942-2003), and his lifelong goal was to establish a center where senescence could be studied, understood, and remediated. In 1999, Dr. Segall endowed the institution, and with the help of Dr. Paola Timiras, M.D., Ph.D. (1923-2008), Segall's former doctoral advisor, they established the Center for Research and Education on Aging (CREA) at UC Berkeley. Thus, on November 8, 2000, the Center for Research and Education on Aging opened its doors.
					<br><br>
					Dr. Timiras, a pioneer in the field of Molecular and Cellular Biology, served as CREA's first chairwoman from 2000 until she passed way in 2008 and made critical strides in furthering our understanding about the molecular basis of senescence. The chair is currently held by Dr. George Brooks, Ph.D., Professor of Integrative Biology, and the Director of Research is Steven A. Garan. CREA has supported many research projects including the development of the Automated Imaging Microscope System (AIMS), which was the first fully automated system that could scan large areas of tissue and reconstruct three dimensional volumetric model of cell populations expressing different receptors. Since its foundation, the center strives to maintain its reputation of performing innovative and cutting-edge research with regular appearances at FASEB, Experimental Biology, and the International Symposium on Neurobiology and Neuroendocrinology of Aging and in publications such as The American Journal of Physiology.

					Paola Silvestri was born on July 21, 1923, in Rome, Italy, just after the rise of Italian Fascism under Benito Mussolini. Paola’s father, a statistician and strong anti-Fascist, fled the following year to France, where his daughter visited often. Even as a girl, she dreamed of becoming a doctor, just like her grandfather and uncle. Paola was an outstanding student and received the B.A. degree in the humanities from the University of Grenoble, and subsequently the B.A and M.D. degrees (summa cum laude) from the Sapienza University of Rome. By this time, 1947, she had married a Romanian diplomat, Nicholas Timiras, and when it became apparent that he would be arrested if he returned to communist Romania, they moved to Canada. Paola abandoned bedside medicine to study experimental medicine and surgery at the University of Montreal, where she earned her Ph.D. in 1952, in the laboratory of Hans Selye, known as the "father of stress physiology." Her thesis was on how stress influences the immune system through the effects of adrenocortical hormones.
					<br><br>
					In 1955, Timiras joined the University of California, Berkeley faculty in the Department of Physiology and Anatomy. Twelve years later, she was promoted to professor and chaired the same department from 1978 to 1984. She became a professor in the Department of Molecular and Cell Biology when it was formed in 1989. Paola retired from full-time teaching in the Department of Molecular and Cell Biology in 1994 but was recalled as Professor Emerita to continue to direct research in her laboratory and to teach her popular courses. 
					<br><br>
					Dr. Paola Timiras and Dr. Paul Segall established CREA at UC Berkeley in 2000. She has published more than 15 books and hundreds of peer-reviewed papers. Timiras and her graduate students, in collaboration with Steven A. Garan, studied the effects of caloric restriction on various hypothalamic nuclei, specifically the effects on cell density, estrogen receptor alpha immunoreactivity and insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor immunoreactivity.
