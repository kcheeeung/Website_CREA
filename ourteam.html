					Paola Silvestri was born on July 21, 1923, in Rome, Italy, just after the rise of Italian Fascism under Benito Mussolini. Paolaâ€™s father, a statistician and strong anti-Fascist, fled the following year to France, where his daughter visited often. Even as a girl, she dreamed of becoming a doctor, just like her grandfather and uncle. Paola was an outstanding student and received the B.A. degree in the humanities from the University of Grenoble, and subsequently the B.A and M.D. degrees (summa cum laude) from the Sapienza University of Rome. By this time, 1947, she had married a Romanian diplomat, Nicholas Timiras, and when it became apparent that he would be arrested if he returned to communist Romania, they moved to Canada. Paola abandoned bedside medicine to study experimental medicine and surgery at the University of Montreal, where she earned the Ph.D. in 1952, in the laboratory of Hans Selye, known as the "father of stress physiology." Her thesis was on how stress influences the immune system through the effects of adrenocortical hormones.
					<br><br>
					In 1955, Timiras joined the University of California, Berkeley faculty in the Department of Physiology and Anatomy. Twelve years later, she was promoted to professor and chaired the same department from 1978 to 1984. She became a professor in the Department of Molecular and Cell Biology when it was formed in 1989. Paola retired from full-time teaching in the Department of Molecular and Cell Biology in 1994 but was recalled as Professor Emerita to continue to direct research in her laboratory and to teach her popular courses. 
					<br><br>
					Dr. Paola Timiras and Dr. Paul Segall established CREA at UC Berkeley in 2000. She has published more than 15 books and hundreds of peer-reviewed papers. Timiras and her graduate students, in collaboration with Steven A. Garan, studied the effects of caloric restriction on various hypothalamic nuclei, specifically the effects on cell density, estrogen receptor alpha immunoreactivity and insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor immunoreactivity.

					Steven A. Garan, a long-time guest scientist at Berkeley Lab's Physical Biosciences Division, was named the Director of Bioinformatics at the Center for Research and Education on Aging (CREA) and is a leading scientist in the field of aging research, best known for coining the therm "phenomics" to describe the comprehensive study of phenotypes. While at UC Berkeley, he collaborated for many years with Paola S. Timiras's group on the role of caloric restriction in maintaining estrogen receptor-alpha and IGH-1 receptor immunoreactivity in various nuclei of the mouse hypothalamus.
					<br><br>
 					Garan played a major role in the invention and the development of the Automated Imaging Microscope System (AIMS). Since the completion of the first version in 1998, newer versions were developed, with the final version being completed in 2007. While computer assisted counting technology has been in use for over a decade, advances in an Automated Imaging Microscope System (AIMS), insure 97% accuracy when comparing computer counts to human counts for both nuclear and cytoplasmic stained tissue. More importantly, automated analyses can be customized to quantify populations only within a target anatomical region, thereby reducing the background noise of non-immunoreactive cells when characterizing specific cell populations. His application was used to successfully map the density and distribution of both nuclear expressed estrogen receptor-alpha and cytoplasmicly expressed IGF-1 receptor in specific hypothalamic nuclei. By using this technology, the evaluation of tissue-level biology can be used to establish neuroendocrine biomarkers of aging and analyze the neuroendocrine effects of caloric restriction and gene knockout models that extend the lifespan.
