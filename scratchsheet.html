		<h3>Our Vision</h3>

		Stories about the search for eternal youth are as old as literature itself, and while scientists still cannot keep us looking forever young, they are gaining new insights into the aging process. At the Center for Research and Education on Aging, we hope to unveil the basic processes that cause aging, with a goal of improving and extending the human health span.
